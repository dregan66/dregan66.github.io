            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p class="about">Our story my be a short one, but its a great one.
                We met at a business meeting. Honestly I could tell you what the meet was about,
                I was to busy thinking about this handsome man that sat across from me from the
                accounting department. Once our eyes met they were locked. He couldnt help but to ask
                me out as soon as the meeting was over in the most adorable way. I was way more nervous
                than I let him believe. On our first date we both knew it was our last first date.
                We have been in love ever sense.
